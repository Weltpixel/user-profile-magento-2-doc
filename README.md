                       Why do you need this extension?

Because all reviews are not equal. Some customers are more knowledgeable than others, and understanding who is giving the review can make or break a potential sale.

Our extension adds a social element to your website by giving each user a chance to create a unique profile complete with bio, age, gender, skill level, and more. It compiles all Magento 2 customer reviews that they’ve left on your products in one (easy to find) place for others to find.

The Magento 2 User Profile Extension also helps the customer create wishlist collections that can be publicly shared with other users. Create collections for different events, family members, or activity type.

Our extension helps you get the most out of your hard earned product reviews by turning your customers into influencers! By enabling them to become trust resources for each other you increase sales and everybody’s happy.
